# Faster R-CNN in PyTorch

This project implements Faster R-CNN using PyTorch. The implementation includes training and inference scripts along with a detailed Jupyter notebook example.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset including images and annotations.
- `faster_rcnn/`: Core implementation of the model, dataset handling, and utilities.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with an example usage of the Faster R-CNN model.
- `scripts/`: Training and inference scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train
